                The Car Warehouse was established in 2002, We have been in this industry for almost twenty years. We are now one of Asia's largest suppliers of brand new cars. If the car is unusual or made in limited numbers then this is what we like, we like to stock the cars that other dealers dare not. <br /><br />

                We hand pick our vehicles and have agents and buyers in numerous countries, we specialize in Japanese imports, including vehicles like Mazda Bongo, Nissan, BMW, Tesla, Ford, Land Rover,Mercedes, Figaro, Elgrand, Estima, Porsche to name only a few. We provide high grade vehicles and prepare to a standard that most could only think about. We deal with all the import process from searching for the right vehicle, purchasing the vehicle, Paying all duty, registration with number plates, MOT, Warranty, Waxoyl Under sealant. If we do not have the right vehicle in our stock for you we can source your car. We may require a small deposit depending on the vehicle you require.
